Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, aimed to develop a resource to help individuals pass their driving exams on the first attempt. They wanted a system with different user levels, allowing access to various types of content. Additionally, users needed the ability to schedule in-person training and behind-the-wheel lessons with certified instructors. The system was designed to manage these functionalities and provide administrators with special features, such as disabling packages they no longer wish to offer.

What did you do particularly well?
One thing I believe I did well was ensuring that I met all the requirements on the rubric. I made a point to thoroughly read through everything on the guidelines this term, unlike last term when I missed a point due to not doing so. It was a small oversight that had a significant impact, so I'm glad I avoided that mistake this time.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing I would revise is the Gantt chart. I didn't revisit the discussion where we posted our Gantt charts, but the professor mentioned something that I could have corrected for Project One. They mentioned, "I feel that your Gantt chart is reasonable, but as I wrote during our discussions, it should be considered a fluid document with potential changes." I definitely would have changed it to ensure it was more adaptable and responsive to changes as the project progressed. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I started by thoroughly reading the interview transcript, noting everything that could be interpreted as a deliverable. Once I had a comprehensive list, I assessed each item to determine whether it could be addressed through software or if it was an external requirement. I set aside the external requirements and focused on those applicable to the software. For abstract requirements like "security," I conducted research to find the best solutions and then implemented them into the design by breaking them down into the most basic tasks and creating use cases for each. To add complexity, I incorporated include and extend relationships where necessary. It's crucial to include the user's needs when designing because the goal is to build what was actually requested. For example, in this project, ensuring that downloadable content is available only to certain users required implementing a login system and tiered user access. Without these features, the premium content would be accessible to everyone, undermining the purpose of offering exclusive content. Considering the user's needs in the design phase prevents extensive rework later and ensures client satisfaction.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach begins with thoroughly reading through all the project requirements and jotting down essential elements in a checklist format. Next, I focus on identifying and isolating the system's objects and their interactions. This process sometimes involves creating a UML Class Diagram, though occasionally I simply make notes to quickly move on to a process diagram before revisiting the class diagram. Once I have both a process diagram and a class diagram in place, I proceed to start coding the software. Building these diagrams helps me identify potential oversights that I might otherwise miss if I were to dive straight into coding. However, in academic settings where time constraints are common, I often find myself skipping these preparatory steps and jumping directly into coding. Moving forward, I intend to utilize activity diagrams extensively to outline how functions should operate. I believe they are invaluable in ensuring that each function performs as expected.
